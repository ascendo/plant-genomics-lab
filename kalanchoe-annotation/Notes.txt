* using BRAKER:
  * Home: https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER
  * Notes: Augustus is a requirement, and proved interesting to complete build in the HPC environment. PerlBrew was
           used to install/manage Perl, allowing for installation of CPAN and install of additional Perl modules. Of
           the dependencies of Augustus, the bam* tools were most problematic, requiring customization of the Makefiles
           to point to the location of various dependencies; and, most significantly, the manual resolution of 
           dependent libraries using '-l:<full lib filename>', e.g. '-l:libcurl.so.4' (this for bam2wig).
